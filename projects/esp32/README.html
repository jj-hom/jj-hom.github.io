Hello.  For the mpu6050.py file, it basically creates an object that takes in an I2C instance.  It reads from the address the mpu writes to and extracts the X,Y, and Z values using a conversion function.  For the motion_detector.py, the values I assumed for motion were greater than absolute value of 1.  I also decided to check motion every 5 seconds.   When the board system is turned on, it will constantly check thingspeak for the last entry.  If the last entry is a 1("ACTIVATE"), it will initiate the accelerometer and start calibrating.  Calibration is done by calculating the offset, collecting the mpu values for 10 seconds and averaging them.  However, only the last 7 seconds of data are used in case the device isn't set at this point. The offsets calculated here are used when detecting motion. After it is done calibrating it will constantly check the mpu values every 5 seconds.  Once it detects motion, it will send a post to webhooks with a payload of the current X,Y, and Z values.  Once the system detects a 0("DEACTIVATE") from thingspeak, it will deinitialize the "on(t)" timer and go back to checking thingspeak.
